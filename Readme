You can download this project and open it as a maven project on your IDE

You will find the javadoc in the doc folder. To access it, open the index.html file.

You fill find the packaged API (jar file) in the target folder.


To use this API these are the command that you should use:

******************************
First, we create a Shapefile object that will allow us to read and write shapefiles
You can change shp by any name of your choice

Shapefile shp = new Shapefile();

*******************************
Then we read the input shapefile and apply simplication to its features
inputFilePath is a string that corresponds to the input layer path

shp.readShp(inputFilePath);


******************************
To write the simplified geometries into a new shapefile, we need to type the following command

shp.createFeatureLine(inputFilePath);

It is the same path as the input path, the function will automatically write the new file into a folder named "output"
The layer will have the same name as the input one but with '_result' at the end of it


Here we need to specify in a way the geometry type

If it is a Point layer use: createFeaturePoint

If it is a line use: createFeatureLine

If it is a polygon use: createFeaturePolygon
